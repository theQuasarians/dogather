## Contribute to project as a Beginner

### Forking and Setting Up the Repository

* Navigate to the GitHub project you want to contribute to and click the "Fork" button in the top right. This creates your forked copy.
* Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Run the following in your terminal, replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username:
  
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repository-name.git
```

* Navigate to the cloned repository:

```
cd repository-name
```

* Add the upstream repository as a remote to sync changes:
  
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner-username/repository-name.git
```

* Create a new branch to isolate your changes:
```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Always create a new branch when working on changes to isolate each set of edits from the main codebase. Some tips:

* Give branches descriptive names like "fix-typo-readme" or "update-contributing-md"
* Use kebab case for multi-word names
* Delete branches after merging pull requests to keep things tidy

Branching allows you to safely experiment and collaborate within the same project. Be sure to follow project guidelines and coding styles. Test your changes thoroughly as well. 

### Committing 

* Stage your changes:

```
git add .
```

* Commit changes frequently with clear messages:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in contributing doc"
```

### Push Changes

* Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

###  Create a Pull Request (PR)

* Go to your fork on GitHub and you should see a prompt to create a PR for your recently pushed branch
* Click on "Compare & pull request" to open a new PR
* Provide a title and description for your PR, and click on "Create pull request".
